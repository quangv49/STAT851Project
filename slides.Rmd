## Outline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Motivation
\item Firth's method - general case
\item Basic examples
\item Firth's method - GLM case
\item Real data example
\end{enumerate}

## Motivation

- MLEs are consistent and asymptotically unbiased, but there is still a shrinking bias term.

- 1D case:

\[U(\hat\theta) = U(\theta) + U'(c(\hat\theta))(\hat\theta - \theta)\]
\[\Rightarrow \mathbb E U'(c(\hat\theta))(\hat\theta - \theta) = 0.\]

- If \(U'\) is not constant, then \(\hat\theta\) is certainly biased.

## Motivation

- The first term in the bias of \(\hat\theta\) has been studied.

\[\mathbb E(\hat{\theta}^r - \theta^r) = -\frac{\kappa^{r,s}\kappa^{t,u}(\kappa_{s,t,u} + \kappa_{s,tu})}{2n} + O\left(\frac{1}{n^{\frac{3}{2}}}\right).\]

## Motivation

Derivation goes here.
